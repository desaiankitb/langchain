    "## Why do we need prompt templates? \n",
    "Ans: when we build sophisticated applications the prompts can be very detailed. (See the slide# 6). \n",
    "Prompt templates are the useful abstractions to reuse good prompt whenever you can. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, LangChange provides prompts for some common operations ie. summarisation, question answering, connecting to sql dbs, connecting to various APIs, etc. by using langchain's builtin prompts and quickly get an application working without needing to engineer your own prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of LangChain's prompt lib is that they also supports output pausing. (you will get there soon!) but when you build a complex application using LLMs, you also instruct LLMs to output the results in certain format. Such as using specific keywords. e.g. (slide #7) shows an example to carry out something called **chain-of-thought-reasoning** using a framework called the **ReAct**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about the technical details here. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Thought: What is our LLM is thinking? It is observed that if we give space to think to an LLM it can often get to more accurate conclusion. \n",
    "- Action:  Keyword specific action (e.g. action verbs viz. search, run, bath, swim etc.)\n",
    "- Observation: What to learn from the action. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parser:** If you have a prompt which instructs the LLM to use these specific keywords (Thought, Action, Observation etc.), then this prompt can be coupled with a *parser* to extract out the text that has been tagged with this specific keywords. So that together provides a very nice abstraction to specify the input to an LLM and then also have a parse correctly interpret the output that the LLM provides. \n",
